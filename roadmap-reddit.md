# React roadmap (with explanations and resources, all in one place)
https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/17h4whn/react_roadmap_with_explanations_and_resources_all/

Hello everyone! I made a _roadmap_ with concepts I wish I knew earlier when I started to learn React, the resources I found were either too simple or too complicated, both leading to problems further down the line, I tried to make it so this resource is valuable for everyone. Throughout my time as a React developer, I've delved into its fascinating aspects as well as its challenges. I hope this post provides value to you!

**Why?**

For those who are just starting out or looking to _enhance_ their React skills, I hope you find this resource helpful. _For a long time, I've wanted to create something that brings together all the missing pieces of knowledge I needed._

**Here is the visual version of the React** [**roadmap**](https://navigolearn.com/roadmap/react-32)**, it has the complete documentation and is nicer to navigate.**

​ **If you want to help**

For those who are already well-versed in React, this resource goes beyond simple React some of these concepts may prove to be useful even to you. I'd greatly appreciate your feedback on what I should add or remove. _I want all of us to contribute to this roadmap in order to make the best resource possible for others to learn._ The resource I pinned above includes a discord where we can talk or you can directly create pull requests on [GitHub](https://github.com/NavigoLearn/RoadmapsMarkdown/tree/master/web/frontend/React/Chapters) on the resource.

This is the knowledge I built over the years, without further ado **let's dive in**.

*   While there are several libraries for routing in React, React Router serves as the foundational library for many of them. When working with different frameworks, routing mechanisms may vary, with some offering server-side routing, client-side routing, or a combination of both. Examples of such frameworks include Next.js, Astro, Remix, and others.

13.**React frameworks**

*   While I can't delve into the details of each framework, as they each deserve a roadmap of their own, it's worth noting that frameworks represent the 'new' way of building React applications. They offer additional utilities and many out-of-the-box features that were not readily available before. I'll briefly highlight when you should consider using each framework and their notable features. When building your next React app, you can evaluate which one best suits your project and make an informed choice.
    
*   Next.js
    
*   Astro
    
*   Query
    
*   Remix
    
*   Gatsby
    
*   etc

_Final words,_

With this, I conclude my React roadmap, along with the knowledge I've built over the years about this amazing framework. Feel free to come back to it whenever you want to level up your React game. With React, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and knowing a bunch of the libraries mentioned in this roadmap, you can build anything; there is no limit."

*   What's next?
    
    *   Get a job
        
        *   We both know a good step forward would be working alongside talented people and learning from them day in and day out. You can build a portfolio of some personal projects, create a resume, and try to apply to jobs, all while continuing to expand your knowledge of React.
            
    *   Expand knowledge
        
        *   React here, React there, all I do is talk about React, but the truth is, whether you like it or not, you will have to expand your knowledge towards new technologies. That's what programming is all about. The more you know, the better you are. Maybe try these roadmaps next.And remember"Experience is the name everyone gives to their mistakes." – Oscar Wilde
